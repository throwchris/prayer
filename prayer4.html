<p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">1 Samuel 1:27-28</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For this child I prayed;</strong> This is after the child had been born. 
  She had received the answer.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth 
  he shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshipped the Lord there.</strong> This was after he had been weaned and was presented to the Lord.  This was Samuel doing the service to Eli.  We see 
  that as she poured her heart out before God, God answered that.  Don’t think for one minute that you can be sincere in your desire before God and pray in sincerity from your heart and God 
  not answer your prayer.  He is going to answer your prayers.  He is no respecter of persons.  If he would do it for Hannah, why won’t he do it for me? Now here is Samuel, and he had made his 
  two sons judges over Israel.</p>
  
<p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">1 Samuel 8:3-22</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And</strong> Samuel’s sons<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> his sons walked not 
  in his ways,</strong> They did not walk like Samuel walked.  He was upright before God.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> but turned aside after</strong> money, or
  <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> lucre, and took bribes, dishonest and perverted judgment.</strong> Changed truth into a lie in other words. That’s what you do when you pervert 
  it.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, And said unto him,</strong> Now these are the elders of 
  Israel.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</strong> This is where Israel first 
  cries out for a king.  They have gotten that polluted, that they wanted a king over them instead of God: an earthly king to rule over them.  You see God says, "I will have no other gods 
  before me."  He knew if he placed a man in there as king, they would worship the king instead of worshipping God.  And he knew what was going to happen.  He gave them their request, but look 
  at how the Lord warned them.  This is what he is going to show you here, how he warned them about this king.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But the thing displeased Samuel, when they 
  said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.</strong> Don’t be afraid to ask God, Amen, about every situation.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And the Lord said unto 
  Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</strong> They did 
  not want God to reign over them.  They did not want to obey God.  They wanted some man.  A flesh being like themselves, instead of the Spirit of God to reign over 
  them.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, 
  and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over 
  them.</strong> He said I’m going to show you something now, and you tell them.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a 
  king. And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you:</strong> Now that is true of anybody that you put in ahead of God.  These are the things that will happen to 
  you.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.</strong> To 
  make slaves out of your sons.  Instead of setting us free, man puts bondage on us; God sets us free.  If you want to get under bondage, you get under bondage to man instead of God, and you 
  will find out that you are under bondage.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he will appoint him captains over thousands,</strong> He’s going to pick your sons to do all of this 
  now.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground,</strong> To listen, to hear the hoof beats of the horses.  We used to have to do that, 
  so I know what I’m talking about.  To see if there is an army coming.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his 
  chariots. And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, To cook. and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take your fields,</strong> God had provided everything for them up to 
  this time.  Now he is telling them what is going to happen when you start following man instead of God.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he will take your fields,</strong> Away from 
  you,<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and your vineyards,</strong> Isn’t that what has happened?  Instead of God leading the nations, man is leading the nations, with kings and presidents 
  and all that.  God knows, doesn’t he?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. And he will take the tenth of your seed, 
  and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to 
  his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.</strong> Now look.  God only asks for a tenth clear back from Abraham.  For everything, he asks for a tenth.  
  Now he is telling them he is not just going to take a tenth, but look what he is going to do.  He is going to take a tenth of everything of yours.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And ye 
  shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day. Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and 
  they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;</strong> Isn’t that just exactly what we are doing?  Instead of looking to God, we are looking to man.  We are no better.  We go right along 
  with the system.  We do not really trust God for the bread that we have to buy tomorrow.  We are trusting our jobs.  I have news for you.  One of these days, it is going to happen when you 
  can neither buy nor sell, and then what are we going to do?  And he said if you have chosen anything else, he is not going to hear you.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Nevertheless the 
  people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; That we also may be like all the nations;</strong> They all had kings.
  <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the 
  ears of the Lord.</strong> He said, oh my Lord, my Lord.  Here is what the Lord’s answer was.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and 
  make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</strong> He said now you are going to break up as a group, as the children of Israel that were led 
  out there by God.  He said go on. Get in your cities. I will give you a king.  Amen.  So instead of them being set free – they thought they would be set free by having a man rule over 
  them – they found out they were put under bondage.  And you know what old King Saul did to them.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">2 Kings 6:11-23</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and 
    he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?</strong> This is the king of Syria, and Elisha was the prophet.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king:</strong> The king knew that Israel was finding out all the secrets of the king, and they didn’t 
    know how in the world – they thought there was a spy in his camp.  Instead of that, this man steps up and says no, there is a man by the name of Elisha that knows the true God, and God is 
    speaking these secrets unto him.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants,</strong> Because 
    they were knowing everything.  The enemy is finding out all the secrets.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel? 
    And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.</strong> Amen.  
    It pays to know God, doesn’t it.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. 
    Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.</strong> To try to catch him, to catch Elisha.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when the servant of the man of God was risen early,</strong> Did you know that Elisha wasn’t a bit excited about that.  That whole army came out 
    after him.  He wasn’t one bit excited about it.  He did not lose a wink of sleep because he knew who God was.  Amen.  No wonder he says we are in the womb yet.  We really do not know our 
    God. Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when the servant of the man of God</strong> When his servant, Elisha’s servant.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> was risen early, and 
    gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?</strong> Or what are we going to do?
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed,</strong> And he knew that the servant knew 
    that just him and Elisha (were there).<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he 
    saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</strong> Amen.  Doesn’t that make you feel good?  It makes me really feel good.  I know who is 
    going to win this battle. Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with 
    blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</strong> Isn’t that simple?  Just because he knew his God.  And do you know that he has given us even more 
    power than Elisha had?  Did you know that we have that kind of power in us?  God himself ruling and reigning in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are so chicken.  It is no wonder God is 
    ashamed of us.  Amen.  It is the truth anyhow.  I am as guilty as everybody else.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the 
    city:</strong> He is telling these blind people now – his enemies.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria. 
    And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes,</strong> Whatsoever you bind 
    in earth is bound in heaven.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.</strong> Their enemy. These 
    are the ones they were going after.  Here they were right in the enemy’s camp – right in the middle of it.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when 
    he saw them, My father, shall I</strong> kill them, or<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> smite them? Shall I smite them?</strong> He hollers it out twice.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he</strong> Elisha<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken 
    captive</strong> Would you kill them because you have captured them?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> with thy sword and with thy bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat 
    and drink, and go to their master. And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria 
    came no more into the land of Israel.</strong> Because of that deed, they did not come back.  They did not want any more of God after that experience.  And do you know in this last day 
    when God empowers his people, or when we get wise enough to use the power that God has given us, they are going to have about one or two dealings with God like that, and they are going to 
    be scared?  God is just being merciful now and shutting his mouth and withholding his hand; the things that he does.  But one of these days, the King is coming back in his full power to 
    set up his kingdom, and then we are going to see things really break loose, and it is going to be worse than any of these things, because this time, he is coming with a sword.  Amen. This 
    is where Hezekiah got this threatening letter and he spread it out before the Lord.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.14</p>  

  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">2 Kings 19:15-20</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Hezekiah prayed</strong> When you get something you do not like, why don’t 
    you pray about it?  Spread it out before the Lord.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said, O Lord God of Israel, which dwellest between the 
    cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.</strong>Now when we ever get to the place to where we realize that he is 
    God – who he really says he is; and that he made heaven and earth; if we really believe it; then we are going to see some things happen.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Lord, bow 
    down thine ear, and hear: open, Lord, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God. Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have 
    destroyed the nations and their lands, And have cast their gods into the fire:</strong> He talked to God.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for they were no gods, but the work of men's 
    hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. Now therefore, O Lord our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that 
    thou art the Lord God, even thou only. Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah,</strong> God sends another prophet.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> saying, Thus saith the Lord God 
    of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.</strong> Do you believe that he is going to hear you if you get sincere with him?  He does not 
    change does he?  Of course, we have not had any great calamities yet in our life to where we really have to cry out.</p>  


  <p class="w3-justify">There is no certain place that we have to be when we pray, or no certain circumstance that we have to be in, when we pray.  Wherever there is a need, God sees you.  He 
    knows all about it.  He knows where we are, what we are doing, he knows the kind of circumstance we are in.  He is just waiting saying, "Here I am, sitting right here waiting to give you 
    everything you want; everything you need.  You have a need.  And why don’t you call me?  Why don’t you ask me?"  He won’t do it until we ask him.  We must pray.  We must learn that he is 
    the one, the source.  If it just happened without prayer, you would not know whether it was God or where it came from.  And then God would not get the glory.  Do you see why we must 
    pray?</p>

  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Jonah 2:1-10</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly,</strong> He even 
    sees him in there.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my 
    voice. For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. Then I said, I am cast out of thy 
    sight;</strong> He thought that God did not hear him or did not see him.  He said, I thought I was cast out of your sight – out of God’s sight.  Have you ever been like that when you are 
    going through terrible things, and you think, "Oh, God won’t hear me?  I’m down in this valley and what am I going to do?"  Every one of us goes through that when we think we are out of 
    God’s sight.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again</strong> Once more.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> toward thy holy 
    temple.</strong> Because they had to look toward the temple.  He was down in the fish’s belly, way down in there.  He did not know east from west or up from down about that time.  
    Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</strong> Oh, what a 
    predicament.  You think you have been in a predicament. And why did he get all this?  Because he disobeyed.  Just because he disobeyed and refused to go and warn Nineveh.  He hid on that 
    ship to get away from God.  Finally, they had to throw him overboard because the ship was going in such a turmoil and storm.  He said throw me over.  I am the guilty one.  I disobeyed God.  
    So they threw him over.  And God had prepared this big fish, the Bible says, to pick him up.  He was down in there in all that weeds and slime and fish guts.  I don’t imagine that felt too 
    happy, swimming around in there with lobsters and one thing or another that the fish had eaten.  It was not a very pleasant place to be.  He says the weeds were wrapped around my head.  We 
    have not been in such a place as that yet.  But I have news for you.  You are going to face some things in this end time, if we get out of the will of God.  You are going to wish you were 
    in a fish’s belly.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;</strong> That old fish would swim clear down and then up.  Can you imagine how 
    seasick he was?  If you have ever had an experience with the sea, you know what it is to really be seasick.  I imagine the smell alone was bad enough, and that slime and the gastric juices 
    of that fish and the stench, everything digesting in there, and there he was.  He says the weeds were even wrapped around his head.  Amen.  Those weeds that were in the fish’s 
    belly.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O 
    Lord my God.</strong> See how thankful he was when he was telling it.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came in unto 
    thee, into thine holy temple. They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</strong> The very mercy that is handed out to us, we forsake it and look for something 
    else.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed.</strong></p>  

  <p class="w3-justify">Amen.  I tell you if you ever go through something like that, you are going to say, "Take me God; everything I’ve got, everything I am, but just deliver me.  Take me."  
    Amen.  But when he got out, he was ready to make everything right with God that had been wrong before in his life.  If you think God does not know how to throw you into a whale’s belly, do 
    not kid yourself.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Salvation is of the Lord. And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</strong> How would you 
    like that?  Now God is pretty great and pretty merciful.  He could have destroyed Nineveh without Jonah.  He could have spoken to somebody else, but Jonah was called to that call, and he 
    was going to do it.  I have news for some of you.  If you think that you are going to slip by easily; how would you like to be in somebody else's shoes today?  I know a man that is pulling 
    his hair out with both hands half of the time, in anger and wrath.  Actually, literally, I mean he is pulling his hair out with both hands.  He gets so angry and so mad that he grabs his 
    hair and yanks at his hair and pulls handfuls of hair out of his head.  Amen.  Do you want to be in that kind of a fix?  Just disobey God a little bit.  Amen.  And this is just the 
    beginning.  Wait a little while.  If you have a call on your life, you had better walk in it.</p>

    with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him,</strong> That he could not win.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> he touched</strong> this 
    angel<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> the hollow of his thigh;</strong> Jacob’s thigh<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled 
    with him.</strong> He really walloped him one, didn’t he?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he said, Let me go,</strong> This angel said,<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for the 
    day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</strong> Have we ever really gotten in a predicament where we got that desperate with God, to where we would say, 
    "You are going to answer me, Lord or I am going to hang on.  I’ll die of starvation.  I’ll never eat another bite or take another drink of water until you hear my prayer."  You see God 
    loves that; when we get earnest with him about it; when we recognize that God is our only answer.  Now just a very few of us have ever been put in that place, where we knew that there was 
    no deliverance outside of God, no deliverance whatsoever.  There is no real deliverance outside of God.  We know it by the scriptures, but yet if you have ever had to face that place: I 
    knew the day that I faced life and death years ago, that I had to cry out for God because I didn’t ever expect to wake up off of that operating table.  The doctors had told me that I would 
    not; just a very small chance.  I knew that I would go to hell.  I knew it.  If you ever get a look at yourself and feel the hopelessness; I knew I was going to face the Lord Jesus Christ 
    in death, and I knew that I was going to hell if he did not spare me.  I knew it.  I knew it in my heart.  Nobody had to tell me that.  I wasn’t going to any preachers, but I knew that I 
    was going to die if I did not find repentance. I knew that I would go to hell if I died.  I knew it as well as I know I am sitting here.  I knew that.  And you can get pretty desperate in 
    that situation.  If I did not have the surgery, I would die anyhow in a few days, and if I did have it, they thought it would kill me.  God knows how to put you right in that fish’s 
    belly.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</strong> Do you know what 'Jacob' means?  'Rebellion.  Stubbornness and rebellion', 
    that is what the word 'Jacob' means.  That is why he finally had to change his name to Israel, which means 'peace'.  The angel asked him, ‘What is your name?’  He said, ‘Jacob.’  Of 
    course, the angel knew his name. But he had to speak it out.  He was rebellion and stubbornness.  That’s what it meant.  Of course, Jacob knew what his name was.  He had been full of 
    rebellion and stubbornness all of his life.  That is why he said you have to help me.  If I face my brother with this rebellion and stubbornness in me, I am going to die.  I cannot bow 
    down in front of my brother with this rebellion and stubbornness.  I cannot confess my sin before him, that it was my fault for all that happened; that I stole his birthright from him for 
    a little bowl of food.  He said except you bless me I am done.  So when the angel asked him that,<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, 
    but Israel:</strong> He changed him.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</strong> You hung in there, kid.  
    Now, I have done the work.  Amen.  God has done the work because you hung in there.  Do you think you are stubborn and mean and everything else ( _ )?  Hang in.  Amen.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 
    And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</strong> Who was wrestling with him?  Amen.  What was that little saying that God 
    spoke about being in the womb?  “As babes in a mother’s womb are we, not knowing darkness from light in our understanding of him.”  There has never been a truer saying come by the Spirit, 
    then that.  Of our understanding of him, we are like babes in the darkness of the womb.  We do not know how to prevail; to get a hold of the horns of the altar and seek God in prayer and 
    get serious about it.  God cannot turn it down.  He says a broken and a contrite heart, God will not despise.  He will not turn away from it.  We need to know how to touch God.  People 
    think that they are touching God when they are getting out here and clapping their hands, and jumping up and down, and making loud music, and tickling the flesh.  In a measure, but you 
    will never grow by it.  Amen, and I am not against a certain amount of it.  But you are going to grow by knowing God and by prevailing with him and striving with him, Amen; until you 
    really know him; until we know him face to face like Jacob did.</p>
