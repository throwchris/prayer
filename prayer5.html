    forget what we are, that we are the Sons of God.  But we are going to know.  It is like looking Christ in the face when we look in the mirror; when that glory and the fullness of Christ 
    comes; because we are going to be holy.  We are going to be beholding Christ that is in us, instead of beholding our own face.  We are going to know him face to face.</p>

    much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire,</strong> Your faith.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the

    which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:</strong> We have that grace.  Do you remember?

    heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</strong> Are you understanding?  I think we missed that whole thing.  Go back to (verse) 11, because we are going to get this. The old 
    prophets had prophesied it first, concerning this grace that should come: the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that Christ should come.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Searching 
    what,</strong> These old prophets.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified

    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Wherefore</strong> Now he is saying, take new heart,<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.18</p> 

  <p class="w3-justify">To me, these are the most tremendous scriptures, some of the most meaningful scriptures in the whole book, right here: that these old prophets had searched so long and 
    God had revealed to them what they knew was coming.  They didn’t know when it was coming, but they knew that it was coming.  And we are looking now for the completion of that very thing the 
    apostles and the prophets had spoken of way back in the Old Testament.  And even Paul had been carried into the third heaven.  It was revealed unto him, the revealing of Jesus Christ.  And 
    here we are sitting right at the doorstep, within a split second from receiving, and going about carelessly with everything else on our mind but that, right at the entrance of the door.  
    He said take hope and be sober and hope to the end.  Do not give up hope, for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; when he reveals himself to us when 
    we see him face to face.  Amen.  And that means that completeness in us that is coming.</p>


  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> 1 John 3:2</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: 
    but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</strong> Not what we think or what we imagine, but we will know him exactly because he will take 
    up full abode within a body, the many-membered body of Jesus Christ, to fill the earth with all the fullness and the glory of God.  It would scare me if I did not know that was truth.  We 
    know that the scripture is very plain on it, of what we are coming into if we follow on to know the Lord.  Then we can take heart and not be discouraged.  But we have to watch it.  Do you 
    think we are going to receive all the glory of God without paying a price for it: to step right into the glory of God and the power of God with full authority in our carnal flesh?  No way.  
    It is impossible.  God must change us.  And it is not going to be a big cymbal or a bam-bam.  We are going to receive it like we are receiving it now, a word at a time, and getting a hold 
    of that word and holding onto that.  And wrestle with it.  Stay on.  Hang on.  Hold what you have lest someone take your crown.  It says let no man take your crown.  That is the crown of 
    glory of God that he is going to give to us.  He taught us to beware lest someone steal our crown.  So when you get this word, hold it; hang onto it.  Amen.</p>
    
  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Revelation 1:7</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Behold, he cometh with clouds;</strong> Now these are not rain clouds, folks.  
    It is the glory of God, in full glory of God, that is going to fill.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: </strong> Well, 
    I thought they were dead and gone.  Oh, no.  They are going to see him.  Their flesh is dead, but their spirits are alive.  Amen.  What happened when Jesus said to Lazarus when Lazarus 
    died, the beggar, and went to heaven? You know I was riding down the road the other day and it had rained.  I left my car in the garage overnight and it hadn’t completely dried.  There were 
    little drops of water in the breeze of the car, and they kept wiggling around.  The Lord brought that scripture to my mind.  He spoke something to me.  He said that rich man that went to 
    hell would have given everything; he's still there; everything.  There would have been no price that he wouldn't have paid for that one little drop of water that was on the hood of my car. 
    Because he said, "In hell lifting up his eyes, he cried unto father Abraham and said father Abraham, send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and that he may put it on my 
    parched tongue for I am tormented in this flame."  Now is that the word of Jesus?  There is no excuse for us.  We have been warned.  When I saw that water out there and the Lord brought 
    that so plain to me.  Think of it, and we carelessly go along our way, thinking we can do anything we want to do.  We cannot do what we want to do, not and make it in.  Oh, we can do what 
    we want to do all right, but we won't do it and get by with it.  Amen. He says every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him.  They are out there looking on just like the rich 
    man is looking on.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.</strong> When they see his judgment coming upon them.  They will cry for the 
    rocks and the mountains to fall upon them.  We have no excuse, no excuse at all.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 5:8</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</strong> The pure in heart, 
    for they shall see God.  If there is any envy, if there is any stubbornness, if there is any rebellion, if there is any hatred, if there is any lying, anything in that heart, if it is not 
    pure, any jealousy, or anything that is ungodly – if it is not a pure heart, they will not see God for he says<strong class="w3-text-red"> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see 
    God.</strong> Now we are going to change a little bit, in faith.  Praise your name, Lord.  There is no reason that I should not serve God.  There is no reason why he should not cast me into 
    hell if I do not obey him since he has left his letter to us.  Amen.  There is no reason.  I have no excuse.  If I go to hell, it is because I love my little jealousy, or my little hatred 
    or my stubbornness, or to do my own thing.  I cannot point my finger in God's face and tell him he is to blame after he gave his own Son that I might be saved, and then he called me into 
    the fullness as a chosen vessel for him.  What excuse do you think I will have when I stand before him?  None!  When that woman, years ago, prophesied over me, years ago, and my friends 
    were with me that loved me so much, and she called me out – I didn’t know her; I had never seen her before, but she called me out – she was a minister.  And she stuck her finger down at me 
    and she said, "If you don't serve God with all your heart, you will die and go to hell."  In other words, obey him and fulfill his call.  My friends got so mad that they wanted to go up 
    and tear her apart.  I said, "What is the matter with you?  Don't you think I know that?  That's truth.  That is absolute truth."  "Well, she embarrassed you."  So what.  Thank God for 
    somebody that will speak the truth.  Why should I get angry because somebody tells me the truth and is trying to save my own soul?  I was walking with God, but evidently, there was 
    something ahead that I might have slipped away a little bit had she not warned me.  So I thank God for that woman.  I don't know where she is now, but I always thank God for her, because 
    she had the nerve to stand up and speak the truth of God.  She said you are going to hell if you don't serve God.  I knew what she was saying.  Amen.  So I thank God for that.</p>
    
  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Acts 8:15</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy 
    Ghost:</strong> Now this has to do with our faith when we pray.  Amen.</p>

    opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</strong> He put them all out of the room.  He kneeled down and prayed, and she was raised from the dead.  Elisha put them all out, 
    went into the room alone with the boy and shut the door and laid upon him and breathed into his mouth and prayed.  He did that several times and then finally the boy sneezed seven times. 
    That always tickles me.  That is such a strange way to be raised from the dead, by sneezing.  Amen.</p>

    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and one that feared God with all his house,</strong> When I read these things about people that really feared God, they must have really feared God or 
    really loved him and cherished him for God to put it in his Word, because nothing but truth could go in here.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> which gave much alms to the people</strong>
    Or gifts<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and prayed to God alway. He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, 
    Cornelius. And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</strong> Because 
    he had given so much to the poor and had been such a kind man and prayed continually, God recognized it and said it has come up before God.</p>

    hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</strong> He is telling the incident again here, but he had been fasting also.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</strong> So I say prayer and fasting.  Now I thank 
    God for all that have fasted, but we cannot give it up.  We must just continue to seek God.  As he speaks to you, obey him.  Do not get careless now.  There are many spirits out here that 
    will try to get you to be careless in these last days and will try to draw you away from that.  That is like when Jacob wrestled with God.  You are wrestling this flesh to try to get the 
    will of God done in your life.  So do not give it up.  I am not going to tell you when to fast or not to.  Let God do that.  That is his job.  And it is our job to obey.  But I know that 
    I have to do it when he speaks to me.  Amen, and so do you if you are going on with God.  And sometimes you do not even have to have him speak to you.  You just know that you need it 
    because you are becoming stubborn or something in your life or there is something that is bugging you.  You are being tempted and there is something you cannot quite overcome.  Then quit 
    eating and go to fasting.  It will break it.  Amen.  And be so determined to say, "Lord, I will die.  I will never eat another bite until you break this thing in me."  You will find out 
    you will get victory, because he knows when you mean it in your heart.  Amen.</p>

    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their 
    hands on them, they sent them away.</strong> That is peculiar to me how the Lord started out about prayer, and now he is right back in prayer again.  I didn’t put this thing together,

  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Acts 14:22-23</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the 
    faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</strong> You see we are not going to get in easy are we?  It is through much tribulation.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting,</strong> There it is again.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.</strong> (One asks, "Doesn't verse 22 shoot the rapture theory?")</p>  

  <p class="w3-justify">I hope to tell you it does.  I heard some preachers this morning just for a minute.  There were four big wheel preachers, you could tell they were really big. 
    They were teachers in colleges.  They had that rapture theory down to a 'T', like we used to teach it.  Right straight down the line, everything.  They knew exactly where they were going. 
    They were going to take off before the tribulation.  That was for sure.  I was that sure too.  I thought, "Oh Lord, it is just a shame that they do not see the scripture."  They get hooked 
    on that one line of thought and it takes God to break it.  There are spirits, actually deceiving spirits, and they won't search any farther.  I imagine those men have been warned like I 
    had, a dozen times or more that it was not exactly right.  Because I had run up against scriptures when I used to teach that, that I could not quite understand, but because I was taught 
    that by the church, I believed it.  But when I would get into the scriptures, it was almost like it would come against it.  But instead of searching, really searching to find out the truth 
    and the false, I would let it go.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify">And I think these men are the same.  Oh man, they were really so happy.  They knew the Lord was coming any day now, and they were going to be whisked away and judgment 
    was going to fall.  What a surprise.  What a horrible thing is going to happen when they are still here.  Isn't it going to be a terrible thing?</p>

  <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.22</p>  

  <p class="w3-justify">This is the biggest lie that the devil ever told.  That is what I have said for years.  It is the biggest lie that Satan has ever got by with.  And you cannot talk to 
    those people any more than they could have talked to me.  God showed me himself, by the scriptures.  I would not listen to anybody.  I would not have cared if they told me.  I would not 
    have heard them.  I was so wrapped up in doctrine in the church that I was in.  I believed they knew it all, and I knew I was nobody, so I listened.  That is the danger.  Because we do not 
    know who we are in God, and you can get wrapped up in anything if you do not know who you are in God.  If you do not know that you are really called and chosen of God…you have to know what 
    your calling is in God or you are going to be deceived.  Amen.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Acts 16:25-26</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the

    I will send you some place else.  If you are in danger, seek God.  Amen.  Don't be afraid.  He says I will send you some place else.  That is no problem for God.  He owns the whole earth.  
    Or he can take you upstairs for a while if he wants to, or down in the basement in this earth.  It does not make any difference; or whatever he chooses.  We limit God to our surroundings 
    and to our circumstances.  He wants to get us off of that kick.  Amen.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify">I love this story here how Paul was shipwrecked and was cast up on this island and half froze to death when the ship went aground.  The soldiers wanted to kill all the 
    prisoners and he said, "Just lay off.”  He said, “God has spoken to me.  He is going to take care of every one of us.  Don't be afraid."  So they let them loose and they swam to shore.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Acts 28:1-9</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.  
    And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.  And when Paul had 
    gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they 
    said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance</strong> allowed him not to live, or
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> suffereth not to live. And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead 
    suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man 
    of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to 
    whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</strong> You see 
    that old snake that hooked himself on to Paul didn't bother him one bit.  He just shook it off.  Amen.  When are we going to know who we are?  We are called Sons of God.  Did you know 
    that?  Not by man, but by the scripture: by Jesus Christ and by the Father.  We have a perfect right to claim authority over any such thing as that and not to be afraid of it.</p>  

  <p class="w3-justify">We are learning to know who our God is. That is the whole secret.  Do not do anything until you feel and ask the Lord what his will is in it.  Do not do anything until 
    you know, because he is supposed to be leading us every step of the way of life, every little teeny step.  If you want to rent a house or buy a house or buy a car or do this or do that, do 
    not do anything until you know it is God.  I am not throwing stones at anybody, but I am just saying learn to walk in the will of the Lord, and you will be surprised at how much faith you 
    are going to have when you find out that he never fails.  Not one time can he fail if we wait, and he will make the way for you.  Oh, you may suffer a little bit.  Oh, you think you are 
    suffering, but we don't really suffer.  But do not do anything without a knowledge of the Lord.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">James 5:13-18</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray.</strong> Oh, we quote that scripture, 
    but do we mean it?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Is any merry? Let him sing psalms. Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, 
    anointing him with oil</strong> Now there are many ways to pray and this is one time here when he mentions oil, but that does not mean that you always have to anoint with oil.  Sometimes 
    you speak the word and they are healed, just speaking it.  And I have been healed without even asking.  When I sat there dying on the davenport that day, I was just silly happy because I 
    knew I could not die.  Then the Lord just spoke.  He said, "Stop all medication."  I did not even ask him to heal me.  I knew he was going to heal me.  I wouldn't ask him for something I 
    knew he was already going to do.  He would think I was stupid, wouldn't he?  So I did not ask him.  But there are many ways to pray.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> anointing him with

    committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.</strong> Do you see why you are not healed?  We have a lot 
    of faults in us; uncleanness, bad thoughts, unforgiveness, and so on and so forth, but if we will get all of it out, confessing one to another.  Bless his sweet name.  It just takes the 
    Lord.  We cannot do it.  I do not care how nice we try to be to one another.  It takes the Lord to heal and to get rid of all of this filth in our spirits.  Those are spots in our 
    garments.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Confess your faults one to another,</strong> Now the Lord is showing us how to get the job done.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and pray 
    one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent</strong> That means hot.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</strong> Of a righteous 
    man, not a faultfinder, but a righteous man.  Do you get what he says?  That is the one that is going to avail much.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Elias was a man subject to like 
    passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.</strong> If that ever happened to us, 
    something like that, we would just blow about it and we would lose all our reward.  Amen.  Right there.  And we would not be around to pray again to ask him to bring it back.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</strong></p>
    
  <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.25</p>  

  <p class="w3-justify">And he was just a man just like all of us.  In the kingdom, we are men.  Why do you think he put that in there?  Just to tickle us, to make us afraid, or cause us to 
    doubt or question?  Because it is a fact.  He was a man just like us.  Jesus was a man just like us.  He was even tempted in all points like as we, and he has told us that he has left and 
    he has put us in the earth to handle the kingdom.  Amen.  And we are scared stiff to go up and speak to somebody and pray for them or ask for them to be saved.  If we do not do it, 
    somebody else is going to.  Did you know that?  I do not think we need to go around and pester everybody, but we are going to know.  We are going to know in our hearts, Amen.  You feel 
    that personal thing in your heart to speak to someone and you do not do it; your mind will talk you right out of it right there.  It will be gone.  You will never do it.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify">It is just like ministering.  When you felt that urge of the Spirit.  Had you not gone ahead with it, it would have gone, and you would have disobeyed God again.  Amen.  
    And we all do it.  I pray we never do it again.  We should all be ministering in the Spirit as God moves upon us.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify">So, we are living far below our privileges in God because we do not know who we are.  We hear it.  We hear it in our minds, but we do not know in our hearts yet, who we 
    are.  And I suppose the Lord would reveal it to us, but we would just blow it all out of shape and then we would not be any good to him.  So we have to have this Word all of the time so 
    that we can go from glory to glory as we have a knowledge, because you cannot come to salvation; you cannot be saved, except you hear the Word.  It is by the Word, faith in the Word, that 
    you are ever saved.  You cannot receive the Holy Ghost except by faith and do according to what he says.  And you won't come into the kingdom except just by the Word of God.  Amen.  You 
    cannot jump yourself into it.  You cannot sing yourself into it.  You come in by a knowledge of the Word and believing the Word of God, that what he says is truth.  That is how we are 
    coming in.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify">And then when the Spirit ministers, then the Spirit will minister to us, and only God knows when we are ready.</p>
