    <p class="w3-justify">We are actually going to see the heavens on fire by God himself.  Amen. We have called it everything else – we’ve called it atomic warfare (and I am guilty of it too; 
        and we will see some of that too) – but actually, the final judgment when he says the elements shall melt with fervent heat, it’s God. God is going to do it with fire and brimstone 
        just like he did to Sodom and Gomorrah. Amen. I fear God. I fear him when I feel him all over my body till I can hardly speak.  He’s just all over. I feel like my very hair is 
        standing up on my head. It is just his power and his anointing on me.  I know this is his word for today.  I know that if we don’t hear these words, we will be judged by the very 
        words out of the mouth today, because it is by the Spirit of God. Amen. Oh, I pray we take this to heart today.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Revelation 16:21</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the 
        weight of a talent:</strong> Which is a hundred pounds.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was 
        exceeding great.</strong> A little ways back, it tells about the lightnings, and the earthquakes, and the thunders, and so on and so forth.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Revelation 20:10</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and 
        brimstone,</strong> Brimstone is the hottest fire known to man.  It absolutely consumes everything.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> where the beast and the false prophet 
        are,</strong> You want to be cast into the lake of fire with the beast and the false prophet?  That is where we are going.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and shall be tormented 
        day and night for ever and ever.</strong> Now this is the last book of the Bible, and he is saying the same things in it that he says in the beginning about Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Revelation 21:8</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and 
        whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</strong> That is goodbye. 
        If you get in the lake of fire, you never come out.  Amen.  That is it. There is no escape.  Which burneth forever and ever.  Amen.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Acts 14:8-11</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple 
        from his mother's womb, who never had walked: The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,</strong> Paul, while he was 
        preaching, kept looking at this man with the bad feet.  He understood that the man had faith to be healed.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on 
        thy feet. And he leaped and walked. And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the 
        likeness of men.</strong> Now look at this.  That is how they felt about it.  We see all of these miracles these days and we pass it off like a whiff of smoke, instead of recognizing 
        and having a fear of God, as we should.  Right?  And you know, (not to bring myself into the picture) the great miracle that God did in my own life two years ago, when he gave me a 
        whole new heart and a whole new body and has completely changed my whole life.  And I have told people, and you would think I was talking about a north wind that blew; no concern that 
        it was the hand of God Almighty himself that heals.  That we have no hope of our own.  There is no way we can help ourselves.  And yet we take him so for granted.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">And that’s exactly what the children of Israel had done and that is why they were destroyed and were not allowed to go in, because all they did was take from him, 
        take from him, take from him, and without thanks and without honoring God.  Now isn’t it the truth?  They ate the quail, Amen, the manna, and then just ran around to play.  Did 
        not obey God.  They spent every bit of their time just the way they wanted to do; doing their little things.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.9</p>     
        
    <p class="w3-justify">And we are living in a much more serious age.  We are.  Time is at hand.  The end is here.  And also, it was quickened back to me; this man that was raised from the 
        dead, when Jesus told him that his coming was so near, and he was probably 75, maybe older.  His coming was so near that Jesus said, "You’ll never have to die again."  He says my 
        coming is but a split second from now in God’s timing, but a split second in comparison, through the ages that we have lived.  So it must be awfully close if it is down to that split 
        second in God’s timing.  And yet we just go on as if we have all the time in the world.  Amen.  And there are things in every one of us – I don’t care who we are – that God is dealing 
        with; and we are going to have to knock it off or we are going to be sitting on the sidelines when God comes in his fullness to set up his kingdom in the earth.  We are going to be 
        sitting there looking, just like the children of Israel, they just marched around.  They did not obey God.  They just marched around.  We have to be careful.  We must awaken and seek 
        God in the Spirit.  There is no excuse for us not to use the gifts that God has given us and to get prepared, that we can go out, Amen, and do the work of the Lord.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Colossians 4:2-5</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;</strong> In 
    other words, this word could be used, “wait”.  Wait on him.  Watch.  What do you do when you are watching?  You are not running, are you?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Withal praying 
    also for us,</strong> Until we get love enough for one another and concerned enough about one another; that we will really sincerely pray for one another when there is a 
    need.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</strong> This is Paul speaking.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</strong> Do any of you ever pray for me that God would give me the wisdom, and the knowledge, and the 
    understanding, and the anointing?  Do you know that it is your duty to pray for me?  Did you know that?  And if I don’t have the anointing on me, do you know that it is your fault, not 
    mine?  I mean it.  Remember that instance where they held up Moses’ hands?  And as long as they held his hands up – that means they were praying, Amen, they were standing with him – then 
    the battle was being won.  As soon as they let his hands down, then the enemy would take over.  The responsibility of one another – and it is my duty to pray for you and I do pray for you.  
    You must pray for me.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Walk in wisdom toward them that are without,</strong> On the outside<strong class="w3-text-light-blue">redeeming the 
    time.</strong></p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Are we learning through these scripture up to now, that it is necessary to pray?  That we must pray?  That is what we started out with – that we must pray.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 6:1-8</strong><strong class="w3-text-red">Take heed that ye do not your alms</strong>Or gifts to the poor.
    <strong class="w3-text-red">before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward</strong> You mean if we do something to show off or get a good proud feeling because we give 
    somebody a gift or something, that our reward is gone?  When A. A. Allen, that big preacher died, and they asked what happened to him. I asked God one day to show me.  I said, “What did 
    happen to him, Lord?”  He said to me, just this plain, “He received his reward of men.”  All of his doing was to receive money.  He had a tremendous ministry; he has gone down in history 
    as one of the greatest for casting out devils and healing the sick; but the Lord said he had received his reward of men, because he desired the favor of man.  Although he would get up and 
    say that God was doing it; but still in his own life, everything that he had done, he was doing to receive that good feeling, that reward of men.  And to spend his money that God had 
    blessed him with on loose living.  He died of cirrhosis of the liver from alcohol, and they did not find it out until late in his ministry.  So if we are doing anything, if we are not 
    doing it with the right motive, you better keep everything in your pocket.  I mean it.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-red"> Otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in 
    heaven.</strong> You get your reward from somebody who says, "Oh, look what he did.  Oh, look what she did.  Look what a great gift she has given."  And that person feels all good, all 
    puffed up and so happy about it.  You have already received your reward.  Don’t expect to get one from God.  That is your reward.<strong class="w3-text-red"> Therefore when thou doest 
    thine alms,</strong> Or you give to the poor, or whatever.<strong class="w3-text-red"> do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that 
    they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</strong> You have already got it.  That is your reward.  That is what he says.  Do you believe the word of God?  
    When you give, keep it to yourself.<strong class="w3-text-red"> ut when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy 
    Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</strong> He’s teaching us how to pray and how to give.<strong class="w3-text-red"> And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be 
    as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
    But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet,</strong> Oh, we love to act religious.  Isn’t that fun; let everybody think that we are so religious and so good when we are stinking 
    and rotten inside.  Now that is flesh.  That is what flesh can do to us.  If we are not careful, it will deceive every one of us.<strong class="w3-text-red"> and when thou hast shut thy 
    door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do:</strong> Now we 
    could get a real good lesson here about praying for the same thing over and over and over and over and over until God must almost get deaf, instead of having faith that when we pray and 
    ask him and believe that you have it, then shut your mouth.  And if it does not come, then trust God.  He says if you know that he has heard you, then you know that you have the petition 
    for which you have asked.  So have faith.  Of course, there is the other scripture of the unjust judge; because of her persistent calling on him, he gave her her request.  Maybe she had to 
    do that in order to get faith.  Who knows?  If you do not have faith, maybe you will have to go back and pray about it again, like I have so many times.  But he wants us to know what 
    prayer is and how to pray and who we are praying to.  If we really knew who we were asking, we would not be afraid.<strong class="w3-text-red"> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, 
    as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</strong> And if we are not careful, that is what we will get to thinking.  Well, I prayed about it for 
    twenty years now, so he is surely going to hear me.  That does not mean a thing. It is praying and believing God that he is going to do it that gets the answer; our faith when we believe 
    he is going to do what we have asked him.  He said if you pray and do not have faith, do not ask.  It is nothing.  It is worthless.<strong class="w3-text-red"> Be not ye therefore like 
    unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</strong> He already knows.  But he said, "Ye have not because ye ask not."  He still wants us to ask him 
    and recognize him that we might know where the answer is coming from.  Amen.  From God.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Matthew 19:13-15</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and 
        pray:</strong> You are right in line with God’s plan if you want to lay hands on somebody and pray for them.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus 
        said,</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Suffer</strong> Or allow.<strong class="w3-text-red"> little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the 
        kingdom of heaven.</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</strong> </p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Matthew 26:36-41</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto 
        the disciples,</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of 
        Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then saith he unto them,</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and 
        watch with me.</strong> Or wait with me now.  Pray, in other words: carry the burden with me.  He was going through a very severe trial.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify">We need to pray for those in authority.  What do you think our president is going through this morning?  Do you think you have burdens?  How would you like to sit in 
        his shoes this morning?  I believe the man really wants to run a decent, clean government.  I believe he has a heart that wants a clean government, but he is fighting all of these 
        elements that are against everything that is decent.  Now I am not for any political person.  I am not saying hoop’de’rah, making my big hallelujah toward President Carter, praise God, 
        but I know that these men that are set in places of authority like that; and many of them are Christians and they try to do what is right, but there are too many opposing forces; 
        forces of Satan in our government.  And they are fighting against everything that is good, and they are satanic forces.  And we need to pray for our leaders and for anyone who has any 
        seat of authority.  That is what he says; pray for those people, that they can do what God wants them to do.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he went a little farther, 
        and fell on his face, and prayed, saying,</strong> The Lord picked those three men to wait with him, that they would strengthen him in his time of real need.  He really had a need.  
        He knew that he was going to face the cross.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying,</strong>
        <strong class="w3-text-red"> O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</strong> What a thing to have to 
        face.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep,</strong> Oh how discouraging, the three that he had the most confidence 
        in.<strong class="w3-text-red"> What, could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is 
        weak.</strong>Let us recognize what we are; but flesh beings and we are weak in this flesh.  And if we do not heed, and we do not listen, we are not going to make it.  The Lord did 
        not put that warning in there just to be filling up space.  Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation.  The spirit is willing because it is the spirit of Christ that lives in 
        here, but the flesh is weak.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Mark 11:22-26</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Jesus answering saith unto them</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> , Have 
        faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart,</strong> Did you 
        know there is a difference in doubting in your mind and doubting in your heart?<strong class="w3-text-red"> but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he 
        shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</strong> The fault is not in 
        God.  It is in us because we do not believe.  Oh, once in a while we believe, and we see some great thing happen, and we get all excited about it, but why can’t we have faith all of 
        the time, to believe?  If we do not see it happen right then, well, believe God anyhow.  Amen.  It has to come to pass if we ask in faith.<strong class="w3-text-red"> And when ye stand 
        praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive,</strong> Oh, I see people all 
        crippled up with arthritis and pains in their bodies, and it comes from unforgiving spirits.  Now doctors have even proven this.  Unforgiving spirits can cause all kinds of diseases 
        in our bodies.  I have heard hundreds of testimonies about the minute they got that hatred out of their heart for someone, they got well.  Suddenly got well.  They knew it was because 
        of the hatred in their hearts that caused them to be sick.  If you are getting sick, check yourself.  I am not talking about a virus coming along and getting into your flesh, but I am 
        talking about these long lingering diseases. And one doctor got so bold the other day as to say he thinks cancer – most of it comes from hatred.  Now think of it.  He got so bold as to 
        say it.  He said I believe cancer very possibly, that cancer is caused by hatred.  And emotional upsets, like a child can get cancer.  It can come from deep-seated resentments and 
        things against the parents.  He didn’t say it was a fact, but he made that statement and I happened to hear it.<strong class="w3-text-red"> But if ye do not forgive, neither will your 
        Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</strong> Now that is the truth.  If we do not forgive, anyone, I don’t care who it is.  He did not single it out, but he said anyone.  
        If you have any hatred in your heart toward anyone and you go to God, you might just as well shut your mouth because he is not going to forgive you for that trespass of hatred unless 
        you forgive first.  You forgive first, then he will forgive you.  Amen.  Now that is God’s word.  That is not mine.  I thank God that that is not mine. Now remember this is on prayer 
        and our attitude towards the Lord.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Mark 13:32-33</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in 
        heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed,</strong> Now look, it is getting close to the coming of the Lord.  He said, ‘Be watchful.  Take heed.’
        <strong class="w3-text-red"> watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.</strong> Let your heart always be in an attitude of prayer.  Now if you can’t; if you are doing 
        something, perhaps in the books and things, you have to keep your mind on your figures, but yet you can stop to breathe.  And you know that you are in communication with the Lord.  
        That is what I am saying.  Always be instant in season and out of season.  Always.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify">Now this is speaking of Hannah.  You remember she was crying out before the Lord.  She wanted a child.  The Lord had shut her womb.</p>

        And why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?</strong> He knew she was crying for a son.  He was trying to comfort her.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> So 
        Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord. And she was in bitterness of soul, and 
        prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore. And she</strong> made a vow, or<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the 
        affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his 
        life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</strong> He would be a Nazarite, in other words.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And it came to pass, as she continued praying 
        before the Lord, that Eli</strong> Watched her<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> mouth marked her mouth. Now Hannah, she spake in her heart;</strong> Can you pray to God in your own 
        heart?  Oh, yes you can.  This is why I brought this story out, that we might see that you do not always have to stand and let anybody even know that you are praying, but in your heart 
        you can pray to the Lord.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. And Eli said unto her, How 
        long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee. And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit:</strong> He was some priest; did not even 
        recognize a woman in despair.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> I have drunken neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. Count not thine 
        handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee 
        thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</strong></p>
