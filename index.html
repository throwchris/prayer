    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>"Without tongues you could never come into perfection." Rose M. Aluli </i></p>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>This message was given To the church on July 29, 1979.</i></p>

    <p class="w3-justify">We really don’t know how to pray.  And we do know that we couldn’t begin to cover the smallest portion in one teaching on prayer or faith.  And it all links 
      together.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> 1 Timothy 2:1-3</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, 
      intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</strong> First of all.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet 
      and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</strong> Now for kings, why?  Because they have authority over them, that they might keep peace in the land, that we might have a 
      peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.  So it is necessary that we pray for those in authority, for our rulers, our governors: anyone with an authority in government or that is 
      over us.  It is a necessary thing.  Now there is something we need to know.  We need to lift them up in prayer.  In a little while, we will probably get to the place where we could see 
      the necessity of things that would have happened had they prayed.  Because they did not pray, things had happened.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For this is good and 
      acceptable</strong> All of this praying for kings and prayer for everyone, and intercessions and giving thanks.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For this is good and acceptable in the 
      sight of God our Saviour;</strong> Now we could stay on that scripture right there and just really learn a whole lot from those first three verses in Timothy, but we’re going to 
      Romans 8.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Romans 8:26-27</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we 
      should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</strong> Now for you who do not have, or have not practiced your 
      prayer language, let me tell you something.  If you are weak, then blame yourself, because your prayer language is what the scripture says causes us to be strengthened in the inner man, 
      our Spirit.  This is where we get our strength, by praying in tongues.  And it also helps our infirmities.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth 
      what is the mind of the Spirit,</strong> We do not know what is in the mind, but God searcheth the heart.  He knows what is in the mind of the Spirit, and the Spirit knows what we have 
      need of when we do not know.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> because he</strong> The Spirit<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> maketh intercession for the saints according to the will 
      of God.</strong></p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify">Now this man that I heard the other day, (who was raised from the dead,) he said that when he died, the Lord appeared to him.  He said he spoke just a few words in 
      the language that he understood, but then he spoke constantly in the heavenly language, which is tongues.  This is Jesus himself.  He said of course he understood it because he was in 
      the Spirit with the Lord.  He said to the Lord, “Why do you always speak to me in tongues instead of the language that I know?”  He said, “Because the natural language comes out of 
      bondage and sin at the Tower of Babel when all the languages became separated.”  That is under the curse.  Our natural languages are under the curse.  So even our language that we use 
      is cursed.  And it is only the language in the Spirit that is pure.  Satan cannot touch that language.  Satan cannot touch it.  That is given from the Lord himself and from the Father.  
      Satan cannot touch the language that God gives you.</p>
     
       
   
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 1</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">So when you pray in tongues, that intercessor, the precious Holy Ghost, speaks to the Father and tells the Father what we have need of when we don’t know.  It is not 
      something to play with or to show off with.  It is to be used.  (When someone gives a message in tongues,) that is the Spirit speaking to the Father, and the Father giving the 
      interpretation by the Spirit to someone else, to be spoken, that we might be strengthened and edified.  It is very important.  Without tongues, we could never come into perfection.  
      All the gifts of the Spirit are given by the Spirit as we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.  They are operated by the Spirit that lives within us.  He says that the gifts are given 
      for the perfecting of the saints. That’s scripture.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">So we must use the gift of tongues that he has given us for prayer.  And don’t think that you have to get all shaken or anything to speak it.  Start speaking it.  
      Let the Holy Ghost take your body.  Let him use it.  You just speak and you will feel the presence of the Lord.  You will feel a drawing in your spirit.  You will feel plenty of the 
      presence of the Lord once you start to minister that gift and let the Holy Ghost use that gift.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">We don’t know what to pray for as we ought, according to the scriptures.  And we do not use the gift enough in our prayer time.  Mainly the gifts are used for prayer, 
      for our own strengthening, and for praying as the Spirit lifts us up in praise in our private prayer time or when we are alone.  And it is used for administering the gifts, such as 
      interpretation, that people might speak.  And there are other reasons, but we will limit it there, because we have so much here.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">(You do not have to speak audibly.)  You shut yourself into your closet.  When I was going through such hard things in my life, like all people have, great stress 
      sometimes in their life, and I would be riding in a car full of the ungodly where it just seemed like it would almost smother me, I could lift my heart up.  You are never alone.  
      I don’t care where you are, you can just speak and let that Spirit flow through you inside.  He said we can speak to ourself in the Spirit, or quietly.  Paul says if you all speak at 
      once, they will say ye are mad, but he says let them speak to himself; that is within himself; the prayer language.  But wherever possible, when you feel like it, let it go.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify">Many times I just kneel before the Lord or lay before the Lord and just give my body to the Spirit, that he might use that body to travail for the lost, or whatever 
      he wants to use it for.  Offer yourself on the altar of sacrifice unto the Lord.  Just give yourself.  Maybe you will never say a word, but first thing you know, you will feel your 
      Spirit start to move.  It is a great mystery that we do not understand.  We have no way of understanding, but this is part of the ministry of the Spirit.  And this is real prayer.  
      This is real prayer when the Spirit takes over and intercedes through your flesh body.  This is the greatest of all prayer.  And when he says ‘prayer and fasting’, fasting is a dedicated 
      prayer because you do not feel much like praying during the time.  When you have been on a fast and your body becomes weak, you do not feel like really praying.  But as you are fasting in 
      prayer, it is no wonder that it does so much for us and for others.  You cannot separate the one from the other.  There must be prayer and fasting.  There must be times of fasting in our 
      life.</p>  
   
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 2</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Isaiah 59:14-16</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And judgment is turned away backward,</strong> He is speaking about in these 
      last days – everything is messed up. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and justice standeth afar off:</strong> Isn’t that the truth?  True judgment – you don’t even see it in our courts 
      anymore.  Justice is very rarely accomplished.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for truth is fallen in the street, and equity</strong> Equality, in other words 
      <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">cannot enter.</strong> Because truth is fallen.  There just is not any truth.  Lying is so convenient.  It just lets everybody out of everything.  
      You hear it everywhere.  The Lord lets me see through – like a lot of us – we can see through the motives.  It just almost scares you sometimes when you see the lies that come forth, 
      that just roll out, like butter off a hot knife, off tongues.  And this should not be.  He says ‘truth is fallen in the street’, it’s become nothing, something to be walked on.  And 
      equality, or equity, cannot enter.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey:</strong> If you walk absolutely honest, 
      you are a prey to the ungodly.  There is always an occasion when you could get out of a circumstance or a situation so easily by just changing the color or something a little.  But as 
      Godly people, we cannot do that. We have to walk in truth.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.</strong> Truth is 
      fallen and it has failed, so we make ourselves a prey.  And the Lord saw it and it displeased him.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that 
      there was no intercessor:</strong> We don’t care about it anymore, not like we should.  No one is interceding that truth might come forward, like we should, as 
      Christians.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> therefore his arm</strong> He sent Christ didn’t he?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, 
      it sustained him.</strong> Or we might say, him that is taken a prey because of truth, then the Lord reaches down and sustains him.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Keep in mind that we are trying to find out what prayer really is: and is it necessary to continue to bombard heaven, Amen, by the Spirit?</p> 

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Acts 12:5-17</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Peter therefore was kept in prison:</strong> Now we know that the Book of Acts 
      is a beautiful picture of the life that we’re … you see, we haven’t obtained all that they had yet.  At least we haven’t by faith reached out and touched it.  Not quite have we?  When 
      you see what happened in the Book of Acts in many places.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto 
      God for him.</strong> That is, by the people. Now what if we would just really all go to prayer for a situation that comes up, do we have faith to believe?  We are lacking in prayer. 
      We don’t use it as we ought to.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two 
      chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him,</strong> Because they were praying.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and a 
      light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. And the angel said unto him, Gird 
      thyself,</strong> Or get dressed.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he 
      went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the 
      iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord:</strong> The gates just swung open.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and they went out, and passed on 
      through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.</strong> There is no chain that can hold us.  There are no bars, no gates; nothing that can hinder the Spirit.  When God 
      says ‘open’, it opens, no matter what it is.  We can escape from anything, anywhere, through prayer if we will operate in faith as we are supposed to.  There can nothing bind us.  There 
      is nothing that can bind us, nowhere, under any circumstance.  Just like Daniel in the lions’ den: God bound the mouths of the lions.  So there is nothing that can touch us if we will 
      walk in faith and in prayer.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when Peter was come to himself,</strong> After he got outside the gate.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> he said, 
      Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. And when he had 
      considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</strong></p>
      
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 3</p>   
        
   
    <p class="w3-justify">I can remember when God used to move, back in the forties and fifties; God would move in such tremendous power. We would have all night prayer meetings. We would not 
      think of going home.  We would pray all night, at least once a week, and then we would see the great outpouring of the Spirit.  We would meet together before the service.  We would come 
      at least an hour early, and we would seek God.  We would be so filled with the Spirit when the people would come out of these different rooms and gather together in the church.  A great 
      outpouring of the Spirit of God; God just had his freedom.  I was brought up on this sort of thing.  When I don’t see the power of God manifested upon the people, it starts to frighten 
      me, because I know God has not changed.  If there is any change, it is us.  I know we’re being prepared in a different way – for a different order right now.  But that was our preparation 
      back there too.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the 
      gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his 
      angel.</strong> They had killed him and now his angel has come, or his spirit.  It is hard to believe.  They were praying, and they did not have faith to believe, yet God sent the angel 
      because of their persistence in praying. They were still praying when he stood at the gate. That’s what it says here.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But Peter continued knocking: 
      and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished. But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out 
      of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.</strong> Just before 
      this had happened, they just killed the other James. In verse two it says,</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Acts 12:2</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he killed</strong> Herod killed<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> James the 
      brother of John with the sword.</strong> And they took Peter, and were going to kill him.  So their faith wasn’t too high.  They were really in desperation.  They really must have loved 
      one another to get that desperate to stay right in there and pray.  They were going to pray that God deliver him, then when he did, it scared them of course.  I suppose it would scare us 
      too.  Amen.  What I’m trying to do here is for us to see the importance of prayer.</p>
